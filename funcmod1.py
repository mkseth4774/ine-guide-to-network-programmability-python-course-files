This is literally ONLY a few functions, but a great example
of a file that I might want to fill up with function definitons
and import to use at some point. I don't want to run it as a 
script, I am just going to keep some functions that do things
I need...thee is NO main() either and no need to check to see
if __name__ == '__main__'

def howdy():
    '''This is my function that greets the user!'''
    print('Howdy!')

def later():
    '''This is my function that tells the user I am outta here!'''
    print('Later!')
